<!--You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Hi, if you're reading this then you're probably the professor that assigned me to this project.  Thanks for selecting me for this project, and hopefully we can accomplish a great VR experience.  I'm going to try my best to do a weekly update format if it is worth making a separate post.  

During the first meeting we discussed the breakdown of the project into three modules:
<ol>
  <li>What are marine debris?</li>
  <li>what are the impacts?</li>
  <li>How can we reduce these impacts?</li>
</ol>

The VR 'experience' will bring the player through each of these modules.  I'm imagining that we want to take an educative / informative stance through this experience while also keeping it enjoyable and interesting for the player.

For the project, I plan to use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UWN0zBDGNM9-y_QMS8O95xAfDA0_zunbU6UnvaE8Hgk/edit?usp=sharing">Project Design Document</a> I found.  Currently it's in a draft form and will take some time to flesh out and will change throughout the lifespan of the project.

Now onto what I've done this week...

I've been following the Unity Premium content tutorials that I was able to obtain through a student license.

This allowed me to go ahead and create 3 different prototypes that allowed me to practice development concepts used in Unity.  The <a href="https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code?uv=2018.4">Course</a> is 37 hours long, and I've completed 23 hours of it currently.  Here are some quick things I've learned:

<ul>
  <li>Instantiating/Destroying Game Objects</li>
  <li>Animation States and Parameters to control</li>
  <li>Audio Sources and Listeners</li>
  <li>Designing a PlayerController, SpawnManager, and CameraController</li>
  <li>Particle Effects</li>
  <li>RigidBodys, Physics, and using forces</li>
</ul>

Some visuals from a couple prototypes:

Goals for next week:
<ul>
  <li>View the projects from Jake and Sayali</li>
  <li>Finish the current Unity tutorial</li>
  <li>Start the Unity Oculus VR tutorial</li>
</ul>

Thanks for reading!
